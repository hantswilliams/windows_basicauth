# Simple Example

This is a basic example of how to use the 'windows authentication' module.

Please note that the authentication module for windows will only work IF YOU RUN THE DOTNET APPLICATION ON A WINDOWS MACHINE. **If you try and run on it on a linux/apple machine, you will run into errors**
